### About Me: "The Translator"

For seven years as an Engineering Supervisor, I lived in the space between high-level strategy and on-the-ground execution. My most critical skill was **translation**: converting complex technical requirements into actionable project plans and ensuring reliable, process-oriented delivery.

Today, I do the exact same thing, but my tools are Python, PyTorch, and advanced NLP frameworks. I operate as "The Translator," bridging the gap between a company's core business goals and the technical teams building the AI solutions. I don't just build models; I build robust, maintainable systems that solve the right business problem.
